                <h2>M.I.A</h2>
                <p> In this project, I worked with some friends to create a fun demo of a narrative-driven game. Being the team leader taught me a lot about team management as well as a lot of technical advancements. 

                I made a deep dive into shaders, with a shader for the skin to show how damaged the player is, I.E if the player was low health they'd be just bones. I also delved into interior mapping for the buildings in the second level; this means that all the buildings have a convincing effect that they have rooms and people in them but are actually just flat cubes. I made all the cube maps myself in Blender and had fun putting little easter eggs inside them for people to catch. 
                    
                I created a custom from scratch save system for this game to quickly save and quick load when they desire.
                    
                I spent more time researching enemy AI for this project, I wanted to give the AI more of a cybernetic feel, but an unpredictable feel. I achieved this by giving them memory, and search functions; for instance, when the enemy would lose sight of the player, they would pick a couple of spots around them to frantically search before returning to patrol. 
                    
                Finally, I spent a lot of time researching level design for this project, I had a lot of fun with this, looking at some of the most popular levels of the past in noclip and finding out what made them so fun, I then took that knowledge into blender and blocked out some levels that had multiple routes and fun moving platforms, acid pools, and plenty of enemies to traverse.</p>

                <h3>Cagney</h3>
                <p> After doing a talk about some of my games at the unfinished things festival, I was approached by a musician to create a game with a focus on his music. The concept seemed fun as well as a chance to try some artistic concepts out. The gameplay is focused on fun little minigames the player interacts with around the ship. My favourite is a re-skin of space invaders called "Rainhugs"; it uses real cardboard cutouts of clouds and other elements that have been scanned in. 
                Spoilers, at the end you pull a load of confusing levers and blow up the earth, which is a video of a blue balloon with vague earth like countries drawn and stuck on being very obviously popped with a pin.

                <h3> Sun Runner </h3>
                <p> Sun Runner started out as an experiment to test out an idea of mine to create an endless runner that performs as well as possible. The performance saved allowed for more complex lighting and a fun art style.

                <h3> The Space Ship </h3>
                <p>
                    I created a prototype spaceship that was a simple 
                    cabin and controls based on the idea of interacting 
                    with everything the player can see, it was well 
                    received and I was approached to make a game in a 
                    similar style to display an upcoming album.

                <h3> The Circus </h3>
                <p>
                    I created this vertical slice to experiment with 
                    more advanced lighting, scene building and character 
                    animation. I had a lot of fun creating the clown 
                    character from scratch, creating normal maps and 
                    textures to make sure the game runs as well as 
                    possible whilst looking good.
